===================================

Installation instructions:

Unpack the distribution.

perl Makefile.PL
nmake
nmake test
nmake install

Enjoy!

Hmmm, it says 'nmake.exe' no such executable.

You can obtain nmake from <http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q132084>
